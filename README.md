## 🌟 Overview

This project leverages AI to control the snake in a grid-based environment. It provides a comparative analysis of different pathfinding and decision-making algorithms, visualizing their effectiveness in real-time.

## 🚀 Features

- **Neural Network Control**: Trained neural network to manage snake movements.
- **Preset Algorithms**: Implementations of A*, BFS, DFS, and Genetic Algorithm.
- **Menu Interface**: Graphical menu to select and switch between algorithms.
- **Path Visualization**: Real-time path highlighting to understand algorithm workings.
- **Comparative Analysis**: Compare different AI strategies in action.
